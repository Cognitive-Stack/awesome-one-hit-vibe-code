# Awesome One Hit Vibe Code

🚀 Build powerful applications/modules with just one prompt using LLM agent tools like Cursor, Windsuft, GitHub Copilot, etc. This is the future of developer productivity.

## 💡 Concept

One Hit Vibe Coding is a modern approach to software development where you generate a full project (including architecture, file structure, and code) with a single, carefully crafted instruction.

With the rise of AI coding agents and frameworks like Cursor Agent Mode, developers can build meaningful, scalable services faster than ever.

This repo highlights the power of this approach using the MCPHub ecosystem.

## 🧱 How It Works

1. Use the instruction_mcp_server.md prompt.
2. Run it on an LLM-based agentic IDE (e.g. Cursor).
3. One hit = fully working MCP Server for a cloud tool.

## 📦 One Prompt Instruction

Use this universal instruction to generate your own MCP server:
👉 [instruction_mcp_server.md](instruction_mcp_server.md)

## 🧪 Example Projects Built in One Hit

Here are five real-world MCP Servers for Azure services, each created by running the single prompt:

| Service | Repo |
|---------|------|
| Azure Storage Blob | [gaia-vault-mcp](https://github.com/Cognitive-Stack/gaia-vault-mcp) |
| Azure DevOps Git | [ares-datahub-mcp](https://github.com/Cognitive-Stack/ares-devops-mcp) |
| Azure Document Intelligence | [orion-vision-mcp](https://github.com/Cognitive-Stack/orion-vision-mcp) |
| Azure Cosmos DB | [atlas-datahub-mcp](https://github.com/Cognitive-Stack/atlas-datahub-mcp) |
| Azure Cognitive Search | [hermes-search-mcp](https://github.com/Cognitive-Stack/hermes-search-mcp) |
| AI Chatbot Telegram | [bull-vision-agent](https://github.com/Cognitive-Stack/bull-vision-agent) |

## 🎯 Why This Matters

- No setup fatigue
- No repetitive boilerplate
- Focus on design and flow, not on wiring up basic components

## 🧩 Tools You Can Use

- Cursor – Agent Mode with prompt-first development
- GitHub Copilot / Copilot Workspace
- Windsuft Agent SDK (coming soon)
